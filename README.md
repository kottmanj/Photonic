# Photonic

Illustrative examples for the optimization of photonic setups with digital quantum computers  
See our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03075) for more information  

The calculations from the paper can be found under examples

# Dependencies
You will need the tequila package  
[get it here](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/tequila)  
and need to add the path to photonic to your PYTHONPATH  
`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/photonic`
