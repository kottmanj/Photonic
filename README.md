# Photonic

Illustrative examples for the optimization of photonic setups with digital quantum computers  
See our [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.03075) for more information  

The calculations from the paper can be found under examples.  

In [slides.pdf](slides.pdf) you can find the slides of a presentation about the topic.  

# Dependencies
You will need the `tequila` package  
[get it here](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/tequila)

Otherwise it will be automatically installed when you run  
`pip install . `
or, for developer mode:  
`pip install -e . `  

If you use Windows or Max OS you might run into trouble here.   
See the [tequila](https://github.com/aspuru-guzik-group/tequila) repo for more information.

There is however no installation necessary:  
In order to use the code, it suffices to add the path to photonic to your PYTHONPATH  
`export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/photonic`  

We recommend to use [qulacs](https://github.com/qulacs) as quantum backend within `tequila`
